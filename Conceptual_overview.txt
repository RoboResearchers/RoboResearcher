## Requirements for an MVP

- What agents are needed to answer a research question?
  - Which of these agents are minimally required to produce a sensible experimental request?
    - Ie. Reporter might be superfluous, and the PI can make the reports itself
- What data is needed?
  - What color is a liquid could probably be answered without any added data (run a spectrophotometer) but what protein binds ADK in a crowded environment might not. 
  - How to access that data?
- What are the API requirements for the CROâ€™s?
  - Can an API request be generated with prompt engineering instead of fine tuning individually?
  - Can we have the AI scrape the internet for academics to contact about including in the project?
    - Ie. Project requires a really obscure measurement that only a single lab in the world can do so it drafts an email to that professor asking if they wish to collaborate

## What other products exist that solve automated research and development?

- Are non-language model solutions already here? Are language model solutions here?

## Which models are appropriate?

- Which ones are the best match for a given problem?
- Which ones are open source?
